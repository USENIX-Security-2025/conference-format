# USENIX Security 2025 Conference Format

## Summary
The 2025 edition of USENIX Security will implement a new approach to presenting accepted papers and fostering interactions at the conference. Some accepted papers will be presented as longer talk, tentatively set to 15 minutes; others as shorter presentations between one half and one minute long. All accepted papers will additionally be presented as posters, during thematically organized sessions that run in parallel with talk sessions. Authors of all accepted papers will also be invited to upload pre-recorded 15-to-20-minute video presentations, which will be published on the USENIX Security web site.

The USENIX Security ‘25 program committee co-chairs and the USENIX Security steering committee welcome feedback from the USENIX Security community about the plans for this new model. We will review comments received by April 15, 2024, and take them into account for the 2025 Call for Papers, which will be available in May 2024. We plan to host an evening session with the community during USENIX Security ’25 to hear from attendees about their experience with the new model.

## Motivation and goals for new conference format

Motivation and goals for new conference format
Rising conference costs and increasing numbers of submitted and accepted papers necessitate USENIX Security shifting to a format with fewer parallel talk session tracks (see the [2023 USENIX Annual Meeting Report](https://www.usenix.org/blog/2023-usenix-annual-meeting-report)). In turn, this implies that the manner of presenting accepted papers needs to change.

In developing the plan for USENIX Security ’25, we strived to make the conference a great experience for both authors of accepted papers and for the audience. We sought to achieve as many of the following goals as possible.

1. **Outreach, engagement, and promotion**. Give the authors of every accepted paper the best opportunity to reach an interested audience. Facilitate interaction and discussion between the authors of accepted papers and the audience, and among the authors of accepted papers. Support junior researchers in promoting their research.
2. **Program quality and attractiveness**. Allow the audience to gain comprehensive insight into all the research on topics of interest to them. Support high quality talks. Allocate time for invited talks. Provide an attractive program to students, junior faculty, senior faculty, and industry.
3. **Fairness**. Give all authors the opportunity to present their research to a broad audience.
4. **Logistics**. Minimize logistics overhead for the audience, authors, and conference organizers, both during the conference and surrounding it.
