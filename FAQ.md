# Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can authors opt out presenting (assuming their paper isn’t a distinguished paper)?**

A: This is under discussion, but such opting out may be allowed. Specifically, authors would be required to present a longer talk if their paper is assigned a longer talk and would have to take part in the discussion track; authors would not be required to create a poster for the discussion track, or to present a shorter talk (if their paper is assigned to a shorter talk), or to create a video to be published on the USENIX Security website. 


**Q: What process was used to decide what the new format should be?**

A: The plan was informed by extensive discussions that involved the USENIX Security steering committee, the USENIX Security ‘25 program co-chairs, program chairs and co-chairs of other top security conferences, and organizers of conferences in other fields. Based on data collected, the program co-chairs proposed an initial plan, which was then iteratively improved via feedback from the USENIX Security steering committee and via early feedback from the USENIX Security community (i.e., potential attendees). The revised plan was approved by the USENIX Security steering committee.


**Q: Will papers be selected uniformly at random for presentation via longer talks, or will a different type of random choice be used?**

A: This is under discussion. Selection may be uniformly random or weighted random, e.g., based on audience interest in topics during the previous iteration of the conference. If we do use weighting, we will ensure that the weighting doesn’t significantly reduce the chance of any one paper being selected for a longer talk compared to uniform random selection. 


***Q: If a paper was submitted to the 2024 submission timeline and received a major revision decision and is accepted to 2025, what presentation rules and format will it fall under?***

A: Such a paper would fall under 2025 rules.
